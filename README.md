# An Enhanced Environmental Monitoring System with DHT22

## Introduction

Environmental monitoring plays a critical role in contemporary issues such as climate change, urban air quality management, and sustainable agriculture.
For that precise temperature and humidity data, for informed decision-making in various sectors including weather forecasting, HVAC optimization, and ecological research, is needed.
Data should be real-time, accurate, and reliable which can be obtained through advanced sensor technology.
DHT22 sensor is chosen for its superior accuracy, wider detection range, and reliability in diverse environmental conditions, from indoor spaces to challenging outdoor settings.
